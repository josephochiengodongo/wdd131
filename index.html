            <p>My country is Kenya, located in East Africa. Kenya is known for its stunning landscapes, diverse wildlife, and rich cultural heritage. The country boasts beautiful savannas, majestic mountains like Mount Kenya, and the iconic Great Rift Valley. Kenya is also famous for its national parks and reserves, such as the Maasai Mara, where visitors can witness the incredible annual migration of wildebeest and zebras.
